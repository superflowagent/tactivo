pb-credit-worker

A small worker that manages sign/unsign/create/update/delete for events and adjusts users.class_credits.

Environment variables (required):
- PB_BASE_URL
- PB_SERVICE_EMAIL (unless PB_ADMIN_TOKEN is used)
- PB_SERVICE_PASSWORD (unless PB_ADMIN_TOKEN is used)
- PB_ADMIN_TOKEN (optional) — if set, the worker will use this token directly instead of authenticating with email/password (useful for superuser/admin tokens)
- PORT (optional, default 4001)

Build:
- docker build -t pb-credit-worker:latest .

Run (example):
- docker run -e PB_BASE_URL=... -e PB_SERVICE_EMAIL=... -e PB_SERVICE_PASSWORD=... -p 4001:4001 pb-credit-worker:latest

and include callerId in the request body.
