/* Global app styles */

/* Removed overly-broad rules that hid client search inputs and absolute overlays.
   These selectors were applying whenever any ancestor had the `cursor-default` class,
   which caused the "Buscar cliente..." input inside the "Crear Evento" modal to be hidden
   / unclickable in some situations.

   If we still need to enforce read-only modal behavior for clients, scope it to a
   dedicated class (e.g. `.client-readonly-modal`) and apply that class explicitly only
   to the appropriate modal container. */
