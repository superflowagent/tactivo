# Archived seeds

These seed files were used for local development and testing:

- `seed.js` — Node script that created users, profiles and other demo data and uploaded files to storage (used SERVICE_ROLE_KEY).
- `seed_supabase.sql` — SQL seed file for creating demo data via SQL editor or psql.

They are archived because they are no longer needed in normal development flow. Keep them for reference or delete permanently if you prefer.
